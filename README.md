## Install

To install docker on Ubuntu I followed the steps in this guide. [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

I also followed the [docker linux post install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) to remove the root privileges error.
